# Objectives

1.  Identify the design criteria (size, range of wind speeds, wind characteristics, functions and modes of operation, target structures that can be tested, range of model scales, and similitude criteria), alternate design concepts, and corresponding components of the facility,
2.  Identify the accessories, equipment, and instrumentation for the tests,
3.  Perform cost-to-benefit analysis and risk assessment to select the optimum design,
4.  Design and construct a small-scale (1/20th) prototype of the envisioned full-scale facility for benchmarking and demonstrating the design concept, and
5.  Create a digital twin of NEWRITE using eddy-resolving computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models, which will inform the design of the physical twin and extend its capability.
